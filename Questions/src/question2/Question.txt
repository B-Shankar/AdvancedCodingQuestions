You will be given an array of integers and a target value. Determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value. For example, Given an array of [1, 2, 3, 4] and a target value of 1. The output should be (2, 1), (3, 2) and (4, 3). We have three values meeting the condition: 2-1=1, 3-2=1 and 4-3=1.

Example:
 n = 5, k = 2
 [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]
 Total Pairs 3
 5 - 3 = 2
 3 - 1 = 2
 4 - 2 = 2
